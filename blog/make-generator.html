    <h4>How it Works</h4>
    The password generator uses a combination of random numbers, letters, and symbols to create a random password. It
    has four components: word + Word + number + symbol. As you can see, the first letter in the second word is
    capitalized. Then, a three-digit number is generated. Lastly, a random special character is chosen. Together, a
    password is created. An example is "grainsCalifornia248%", which will be a secure password.
    <h4>How We Made It</h4>
    First, we made a list of possible words. These words were all at least five letters long. This makes the password
    more secure because it has more characters. Then, we listed possible characters.
    Our code then established “wordString” as “word1” and “word2”, in which “word1” is lowercase while “word2” starts
    with a capital letter. These words were taken from our list of possible words. Then, we let “number” be any
    three-digit number. “specialChar” are the special characters that were listed earlier. The password would be
    “wordString” + “number” + “specialChar”, which would be returned.
