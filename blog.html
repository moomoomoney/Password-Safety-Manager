  <h2>How Did You Make the Password Generator?</h2>
  <div id="blog1">
    <img src="../images/password1.png" width="500" height="250"></img> <br><br>
    The password generator uses a combination of random numbers, letters, and symbols to create a random password. It
    has four components: word + Word + number + symbol. As you can see, the first letter in the second word is
    capitalized. Then, a three-digit number is generated. Lastly, a random special character is chosen. Together, a
    password is created. An example is "grainsCalifornia248%", which will be a secure password.
